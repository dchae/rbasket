- Back-end is implemented with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
- Basket and request metadata are stored in PostgreSQL.
- Request payload data is stored in MongoDB.
- State persistence is implemented via browser local storage, allowing users to access the same baskets across sessions.

## Configuration

Depending on the settings of your `psql` and `mongod` services, you may need to specify some connection options like user, password, port, etc.
To do so, create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory according to the format of the provided `.env.example` file:

```env
# Example .env file
# All values are optional

# Application port
PORT=3000             # Port the backend server will run on

# Postgres configuration
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=rbasket
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=password

# MongoDB configuration
MONGO_HOST=localhost
MONGO_DBNAME=requestBodies
MONGO_USER=mongoUser
MONGO_PASS=password
MONGO_TLS=true
MONGO_CA_PATH=/path/to/tlsCertKeyFile.pem
MONGO_REPLICA_SET=rs0
MONGO_READ_PREF=secondaryPreferred
MONGO_RETRY_WRITES=false
MONGO_AUTH_SRC=admin

```

ðŸ’¡**Note:** Ensure that PostgreSQL and MongoDB are installed and running locally with the above credentials. You may need to adjust these values to match your environment.

## Installation

Navigate to the `backend` directory

```bash
cd backend
```

Build the full project

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the application

```bash
npm start
```

If serving on `nginx`:

```bash
npm run nginx
```

- copies contents of `dist/` to `/var/www/rbasket`
- dist/ should be built with `npm run build` or `npm run build:frontend` first.
